    "### 1. Filter coefficient interpolation\n",
    "\n",
    "One easy way to create a dynamically controllable filter is to take two stationary filters and interpolate between them, where the control signal determines how much each of the two filters contributes to the final filter. We can directly interpolate the **filter coefficients B (and optionally A for IIR filters)** , where the result will be a new B (and A) representing the new filter.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need a refresher about the technique of linear interpolation, you can consult [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_interpolation). As a simple example, suppose we have a control signal ranging between $0$ and $1$. Assume that we want a control value of $0$ to correspond to a FIR filter 1 with coefficients $B_1$ and a control value of $1$ to correspond to a FIR filter 2 with coefficients $B_2$. Then we can create a filter for control values between 0 and 1 by taking a fraction of filter 1's coefficients and the complementary fraction of filter 2's coefficients such that both fractions sum to 1:\n",
    "$B(x) = (1-x) B_1 + x B_2$. Note that $B(0) = B_1$ and $B(1) = B_2$. A filter for a control value of $0.4$ would be $B(0.4)=0.6 B_1 + 0.4 B_2$, for instance. The full formula for arbitrary ranges of control values can be found on Wikipedia."

These filters can be different in cut-off frequencies or different types.

Smoothly varying the interpolation values will give you a smooth transition between two filters, which will come in handy for the PG coursework.\n",

    "### 2. Real-time convolution\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to apply a dynamic FIR filter to a signal (as in the PG coursework), we can't just apply [`convolve`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.signal.convolve.html) from `scipy.signal`, since that function only takes one, static set of filter coefficients B. We therefore need to implement convolution ourselves in a for loop, based on its definition: \n",

    "\\mathrm{conv}(filter, signal)[t] = \\Sigma_{n=0}^{len(signal)} filter[t-n] \\; signal[n]\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, we can change the filter coefficients in ever iteration of the for loop. We're not going to do that here, but it's part of the PG coursework. In this exercise, we're just going to reimplement a normal convolution. Complete the function `convolution_loop` based on the definition of the convolution. Remember that the output will be longer than the input (equal to $len(signal) + len(filter) - 1$).\n",
    "\n",
    "The easiest way to implement the convolution is to let the shorter filter slide over the longer signal by taking consecutive slices of the signal using the `[start:end]` syntax. The [`np.dot`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.dot.html) function can then be used to sum the products of the lined-up signal slices and the filter, thereby producing the corresponding convolution output. You can use the function [`np.flip`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.flip.html) to reverse the filter coefficients beforehand. To handle the beginning and end of the convolution, where filter and signal only partially overlap, the signal should be extended with zeros at the beginning and end. Check [`np.pad`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.pad.html) for information on how to do this."
